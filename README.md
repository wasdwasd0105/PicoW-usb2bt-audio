### Driver-Free Setup
Setting up PicoW requires no driver or software installation. Simply plug the Pico W into your device's USB port, set your Bluetooth headphones or speakers to pairing mode, and an automatic connection will be made.


### Multiple Bluetooth Codecs
Pico W Bluetooth Adapter utilizes multiple codecs to deliver high-quality audio. 

#### LDAC
The input is 16-bit 44100Hz PCM audio, and it can steam LDAC audio at 303(Mobile Quality) on Pico W and 606(Standard Quality) Kbps/ 909 Kbps on Pico 2 W.

#### SBC
Ready to use

## Installation

Installing the Pico W USB Audio to Bluetooth Adapter firmware involves flashing a UF2 (USB Flashing Format) file onto your Raspberry Pi Pico. Follow these steps:

1. **Download the UF2 file:** You can find the latest firmware for the PicoW USB Audio to Bluetooth Adapter at the [releases page](https://github.com/wasdwasd0105/PicoW-usb2bt-audio/releases) of the GitHub repository. Download the `.uf2` file from the latest release.

2. **Connect the Pico to your computer:** First, ensure that your Pico is not connected to your computer. Then, hold down the 'BOOTSEL' button on the Pico while you plug it into your computer using a micro USB cable. It will appear on your computer as a mass storage device (like a USB flash drive).

3. **Copy the UF2 file:** Simply drag and drop (or copy and paste) the downloaded UF2 file onto the Pico.

4. **Reset the Pico:** Once the UF2 file has been copied onto the Pico, it will automatically reset and start running the new firmware.



## Usage

Using the PicoW USB Audio to Bluetooth Adapter is a straightforward process. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Connect your Pico W to your audio source device:** Use a USB cable to connect your Raspberry Pi Pico W to the device that you want to stream audio from.

2. **Set the audio output on your source device:** On your audio source device, go to your sound settings and change the audio output device to `USB Bluetooth Audio`.

3. **Pairing a new device:** To pair a new device, long press the 'BOOTSEL' button on the Pico W and release it the led light will blink fast. Then, put the new Bluetooth device into pairing mode. The Pico W will automatically connect to it.

4. **Start playing audio:** Once everything is set up, you can start playing audio from your source device. The audio will be streamed to your Bluetooth device via the Pico W.

5. **Reconnecting a device:** You can connect/reconnect the headphone by short pressing the 'BOOTSEL' button when it is not streaming audio (LED light not blinking)

6. **Switch Codec:** While audio is streaming, you can short press the 'BOOTSEL' button to switch codec. You should need to press the key twice to switch the codec.
7. If you press the key for times but it has no response. It means it is crash. Please reconnect the USB. 



## Green LED light Status Indicator

1. **Blinking Slow (1s):** When the Green LED light is blinking slow, it indicates that audio is currently streaming. Different LED light on time means different streaming mode:

| LED on time | codec |
|-------------|-------|
| 0.2s        | LDAC  |
| 1s          | SBC   |

2. **Blinking Fast (0.5s):** It means that the PicoW Adapter is in pairing mode.
3. **On (Steady Light):** It means that the PicoW Adapter is on standby. Short-press the key to reconnect the last saved device.
   

## Compile & Debug

In order to compile the PicoW USB Audio to Bluetooth Adapter firmware from source code, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your environment:** Use VS Code and Raspberry Pi Pico extension

2. **Import the project on the Raspberry Pi Pico extension:** Import the project using General -> Import Project

Choose Pico W or Pico 2 W using Switch Board

Then you can Debug, Compile and Run the project on the Project tab

3. **Debug Serial input/output:** You can use uart to see the debug info. Connect the GPIO 0 and 1 as TX and RX. To enable BTstack's serial input, you can uncomment `HAVE_BTSTACK_STDIN` under btstack_config.h
